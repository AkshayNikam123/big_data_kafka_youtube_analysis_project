"Unable to import module 'lambda_function': No module named 'awswrangler'" error while running lambda function 
when you create zip file of venv with that library and actual .py file its extraction should not be be greate than 250mb


python -m venv venv

.\venv\Scripts\Activate #activate venv in cmd or power shell

pip install awswrangler install wrangler on that

deactivate from venv

Run the following command to set the execution policy to unrestricted:
#if error occur   use this command -----   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

Compress-Archive -Path .\your_lambda_function.py, .\venv\Lib\site-packages -DestinationPath deployment_package.zip
e.g Compress-Archive -Path "C:\Users\akshay\Desktop\lambdafunction.py", .\venv\Lib\site-packages -DestinationPath deployment_package.zip
#pwd should be desktop to access lambda file as its on desktop likewise any folder where lambda function .py file is located
destination path will be same as pwd and will create folder deployment_package.zip


#from local to aws s3 bukcet i.e youtubeanalysisdata
aws s3 cp deployment_package.zip s3://youtubeanalysisdata/    

from s3 after uploading object loaction of zip file and copy that in new layer in upload section it must not be greater than 250 mb
in my case it was above 250 i.e lambda will unzip it but that should not exceed 250 mb
